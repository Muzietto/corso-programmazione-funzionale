1. Extend the signature of Queue with the following operations

- isEmpty qs, which checks if qs is empty
- size qs,  computing the length of qs
- ofList xs, which builds a queue starting from a given list
- toList qs, which turns a queue into the corresponding list
- put_list xs qs, which adds the elements of a list xs to a queue qs,
  returning the resulting queue

2. Implement those operations in the pairs of list representation

3. Create a dll library, say Q.dll

4. Rewrite the code for breadth-first function so that it does *not*
use lists but only queue operation as provided by the library Q.dll
analogously to what we did for depth-first and Stack. This is not
completely trivial, so do not get discouraged.
